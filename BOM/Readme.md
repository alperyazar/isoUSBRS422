# BOM (Bill of Materials)

All components are listed in **isoUSBRS422_BOM.txt** file by reference and value seperately.

When I soldered boards for testing, I used passive components that are available for me. I recommend X5R or X7R ceramic capacitors. Film resistors with 1% tolerance should be fine.  

For all components, please see **isoUSBRS422_BOM_v1.pdf** or **isoUSBRS422_BOM_v1.xlsx** files. For up-to-date price and BOM information, please visit http://www.alperyazar.com/r/isoUSBRS422BOMv1
